This code sets a property value in a map if the property is not read-only and not in a filter list . If the new value is null and the current value is not null and not a RemoveProperty instance, it marks the property for removal . If the new value is different from the current value, it updates the property . If the property is already marked for modification and the new value is different from the modified value, it updates the modification .
Removes a property from the authorizable or modified map if it is not read-only and the property exists in either map .
This code adds a new principal to the list if the system is not in read-only mode and the principal does not already exist in the list .
This method removes a specified principal from the list of principals if the list is not read-only and the principal exists in the list . If the principal is successfully removed, it sets the principalsModified flag to true .
This code removes packet, reader, and writer listeners when the root window is closing .
This code is a method that handles user encounters, it creates a list of descriptors, checks certain conditions to add specific descriptors, creates a presence event, and fires the event if it's present .
Handles events related to presence or leaving, updating the presence status and last seen time accordingly .
This code checks if a resource from a ResourceModel object is a boolean, returning true if it is and false if it isn't .
This code changes the name of a roster entry and sends an updated roster packet to the server . It first removes the old name from the group names list, adds the new name, and then creates a new roster item with the updated information . The updated roster item is then sent to the server .
Checks if the given key exists in the hash table by calculating its hash code and comparing it with existing entries . Returns true if the key is found, otherwise returns false .
This code checks if a specific value exists in the hash table, returning true if found and false if not .
This code is a method that inserts a key-value pair into a hash map, and if the key already exists, it updates the value and returns the old value . If the key does not exist, it adds a new mapping and returns null .
This code method clears all entries in a hash data structure by setting each entry to null and resetting the size to 0 .
This Java code defines a hash function that takes an object key as input, calculates its hash code, and then applies a series of bitwise operations to generate a final hash value .
This Java method checks if two keys are equal by comparing their references and their content .
Determines if two given objects are equal either by reference or based on their content .
The first code snippet is a garbage collector for expired streams, the second attempts to reconnect to a Redis database, and the third expands a hash table when its load factor is exceeded .
This Java method calculates and returns a new capacity value based on a proposed capacity, ensuring it does not exceed a maximum capacity limit . If the proposed capacity is greater than the maximum, the maximum is returned . Otherwise, the method continuously doubles the new capacity until it is greater than or equal to the proposed capacity, but not exceeding the maximum capacity .
Creates an iterator for the entry set of a map . If the map is empty, returns an instance of EmptyIterator, otherwise returns a new instance of EntrySetIterator .
This method loads data from an input stream into a map, checking if the key matches and if the object type is as expected, and throws an IOException if these conditions are not met .
This code registers various models such as content generators, event controllers, output plugins, output extensions, output controllers, and activators . It also handles exceptions for illegal IDs during the registration process .
Initializes an add-on by setting up its context .
Notifies all connection listeners about a failed reconnection attempt if reconnection is allowed .
This code notifies about an attempt to reconnect after a specified number of seconds, if reconnection is allowed .
