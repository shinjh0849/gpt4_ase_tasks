This function performs an analysis similar to 'analysis2' method but does not return excluded line numbers .
The function 'analysis2' analyzes a given module or filename to determine its coverage statistics and returns a tuple containing the filename, lists of line numbers for executable, excluded, and not run statements, and a formatted string of missing line numbers .
The function '_analyze' processes a single code unit or morf, converts it into a 'CodeUnit' object if it's not, and returns an 'Analysis' object .
The function 'report' generates a summary report of module coverage, including counts of statements, executed statements, and missing statements, and writes it to a specified file . It returns the total percentage of coverage .
The function 'annotate' annotates a list of modules by marking the coverage of each line in a new file, using the arguments provided and the 'AnnotateReporter' class .
The function 'html_report' generates an HTML report with coverage details, writes it to a specified directory, applies additional CSS if provided, and returns the total percentage of code covered .
The code defines a method to generate an XML report of coverage results compatible with Cobertura reports, taking in parameters for modules, output file, and other configurations . It handles file opening, closing, and potential deletion in case of exceptions .
The code defines a function to display Python objects in all frontends, allowing for specific format types to be included or excluded .
The function 'display_html' displays the HTML representation of given Python objects or raw HTML data based on the 'raw' parameter .

The function 'display_png' displays the PNG representation of given Python objects or raw PNG data based on the 'raw' argument .
The function display_jpeg takes in objects and a boolean flag 'raw' . If 'raw' is True, it publishes the JPEG representation of each object directly . Otherwise, it displays the objects in 'text/plain' and 'image/jpeg' formats .
This Python function displays the LaTeX representation of given objects, with an option to handle raw LaTeX data .
The code defines a function to display the JSON representation of an object, with an option to handle raw data or Python objects that need formatting before display .
The function 'display_javascript' displays the JavaScript representation of given Python objects or raw JavaScript data based on the 'raw' parameter .
The code reloads data from a file or URL, handling different encodings if specified .
The function `_find_cmd(cmd)` finds and returns the full path of a given command using the 'which' command .
The code defines a method to execute a system command in a subshell using pexpect, handling output and exceptions, and returning the exit status of the command .
The code defines a function to forward read events from a file descriptor over a socket using ZeroMQ, creating a new context if none is provided .
The code reads lines from a file, determines whether they are in unicode or not, sends them over a socket, and closes the file and socket when done .
The function find_launcher_class returns a launcher class for a given class name and kind, where the class name can be either a full name with or without the module path, or an abbreviation, and the kind can be either 'EngineSet' or 'Controller' .
The code is for a method that stops a running app or cluster, handling different scenarios such as when the cluster is not running, when the PID file cannot be read, or when the cluster fails to stop, with specific behaviors for POSIX and NT operating systems .
The function 'build_launcher' imports and instantiates a Launcher class based on the provided class name and kind, handling any import errors and key errors .
The code starts the application for the engines subcommand, checks if the cluster is already running, logs and daemonizes the process if applicable, starts the engines using a delayed callback, and handles potential exceptions .
The code is for starting an application, it first checks if the application is already running, if not, it logs the start, daemonizes if necessary, starts the controller and engines, writes a new PID file, and starts the event loop, handling any interruptions or errors and finally removing the PID file .
The code creates a new wxPython application if none exists, or returns the existing one, with an option to redirect standard output .
The code checks if the wx event loop is running for a given application or the default application .
The code starts the wx event loop consistently, creating a new app if none is provided and ensuring the event loop is not already running .
The code creates a new QT4 application or returns an existing one, with the ability to pass arguments and keyword arguments .
The function checks if the qt4 event loop is running for a given application, defaulting to a specific application if none is provided .
The code starts the qt4 event loop consistently, creating a new app if none is provided, and checks if the event loop is already running before starting it .
The code defines a function that creates and returns a blank canvas of specified width and height .
